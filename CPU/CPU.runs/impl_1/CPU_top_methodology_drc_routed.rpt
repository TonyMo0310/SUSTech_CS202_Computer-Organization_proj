2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net fpga_clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): fpga_clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock cpuclk/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock fpga_clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks fpga_clk and clk_out1_cpuclk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks fpga_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_cpuclk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks fpga_clk and clk_out2_cpuclk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks fpga_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_cpuclk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks fpga_clk and clk_out1_cpuclk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks fpga_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_cpuclk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT dataMem/ram_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
